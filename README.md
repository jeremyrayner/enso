# enso

A program to help manipulate abstract puzzle designs into physical puzzles.

## Getting Started

If you are wanting to use enso, visit <a href="http://jeremyrayner.com/puzzles/enso">jeremyrayner.com/puzzles/enso</a> website for the User Guide.

The rest of these instructions are for anyone who wants to use the source code.
These instructions will get you a copy of **enso** up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

To develop the software you will need Java:

<u>Java 8 or above</u>

If you don't already have Java installed, download and unpack latest stable Java version for Windows, Mac or Linux from [https://jdk.java.net/](https://jdk.java.net/)

Alternatively, you can install the latest long-term-support JDK on debian based systems with:
```
sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk
```

### Installing

To get a development environment up and running

```
git clone https://github.com/jeremyrayner/enso.git
cd enso
```

Then to run tests and build the software

```
./gradlew clean build
```

To verify it has worked try running this, you should then see the help screen.
```
java -jar build/lib/enso-1.0.1-SNAPSHOT-all.jar
```

### Coding Style

This project uses **spotbugs** to provide static analysis of the code, as an extra layer of assurance during the build

## Deployment

The final distributables are available in the folder:
```
build/distributions
```

## Built With
